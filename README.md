# select-undo.nvim

## Overview

Select-Undo is a Neovim plugin that enhances undo functionality by allowing users to undo changes selectively. Unlike the default undo command, which reverts changes sequentially, Select-Undo enables users to undo specific lines or partial selections without affecting the rest of the file.

## Features
	•	Persistent Undo: Ensures that undo history persists even after closing Neovim.
	•	Selective Line Undo: Undo only the changes within selected lines (gu).
	•	Partial Undo: Undo changes within a visual selection (gcu).
	•	Visual Mode Integration: Works seamlessly with Neovim’s visual mode for intuitive selection-based undo.
	•	Customizable Keybindings: Default mappings are provided, but users can configure their own.
	•	Undo by Line Number: Quickly undo a specific line using <C-s>u.

  line_mapping = "gu",     -- Undo for entire lines
  partial_mapping = "gcu"  -- Undo for selected characters
})
